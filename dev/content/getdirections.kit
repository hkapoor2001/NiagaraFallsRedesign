                NOTE: While there are four parking lots in the State Park, they tend to fill up early on weekends (including Friday) and holidays which results in severe traffic entering the park from the Niagara Scenic Parkway and in some cases, all the way onto Grand Island (I-190). In order to avoid that, you might consider using alternate means into the city. Rt. 62/Niagara Falls Blvd. either from the I-290 or the I-190 if you choose to stay on this road, is a perfect way to enter the downtown core while avoiding traffic backups. This route will take you on city streets and add a few minutes to your trip but could save a great deal of time stuck in traffic. Once in the downtown core, you way park in a number of city lots that are just moments from the park. Additionally, you may consider using an alternate GPS address of 10 Rainbow Blvd., Niagara Falls, NY 14303 to take you to the official Niagara USA Welcome Center and alternate parking options.
